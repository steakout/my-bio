# my-bio
-- a backup of my ponytown bio just in case patreon gets borked


**hi i am a bio. do read thanks**


**-** pronouns are he/him. use these *always regardless of who my character is,* thanks :)

**-** i also use it/its but if you're a coward you can just call me he

**-** if my horse has "dni" or "rp dni" in its name then please dont interact

**-** i'm really shy to the point of nervousness; please don't pressure me to talk/be friends

**-** do not flirt/use the kiss emote on me ever. it's uncomfortable.

**-** please don't yell in chat and run up to me if you recognise my character from a piece of media you like, it's really bothersome.

**-** i generally would like to just be left alone a lot of the time :)


**dont inter act:**


**-** bigots/exclus (i dont want a debate, i just want you to leave me alone)

**-** people who bully kids on the safe server*

**-** people who bully others for not having "good skins" in general

**-** people who start drama that goes on for like 3 hours, its a pony game who cares (*cough cough* the docks *cough*)

**-** overly sexualised skins/jokes in the safe server (ew)

*i do not care if that kid is being "cringe" or doesn't have the best skins ever, leave them be. they're just trying to have fun. plus, heaps of kids like mlp too, it's not just for teens/adults. they are not your enemy and they do not need to be bullied by some sad loser online. it's a silly pony game, let them have fun.

**thats all thanks :)**
